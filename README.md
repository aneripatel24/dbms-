I. Storyline
In the bustling world of construction, where timelines are tight, resources are precious, and coordination is key, the need for an efficient and robust Construction Management System (CMS) is paramount. This proposal outlines the development of a comprehensive CMS as a database project to address the challenges faced by construction companies in managing their projects effectively. Construction projects involve numerous stakeholders, including clients, architects, engineers, contractors, suppliers, and laborers. Coordinating these stakeholders and managing various aspects of a project, such as scheduling, budgeting, resource allocation, and documentation, can be incredibly complex without a centralized system in place.

Introduction
The Construction Management System (CMS) aims to provide a comprehensive database solution for construction companies or project managers to streamline their operations. The system will facilitate the management of various elements including projects, clients, employees, vendors, equipment, materials, budgets, schedules, and more.


Conclusion

The project employs a modular approach to database design, with separate tables for clients, labour, materials, suppliers, equipment, invoices, transactions, permits, and inspection logs. This The project also demonstrates the use of an entity-relationship model to define relationships between different entities. Relationships such as one-to-many and many-to-many are established using foreign key constraints, ensuring data integrity and consistency.modular design allows for better organization and management of construction-related data. Foreign key constraints are used to enforce referential integrity between related tables, ensuring that references to primary keys are valid and preventing orphaned records. The system includes a table for recording transactions related to invoices, allowing for the tracking of payments and financial transactions associated with each project.
